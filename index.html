<h3>Heres a poem I wrote for you while learning how to make a list!</h3>
<h3>I hope you like it sweetie :> </h3>
<ul>
    <li>You're the prettiest girl with the most gorgeous sound</li>
    <li>You're the love of my life and my soulmate I'm so lucky I found</li>
    <li>My eyes glow brighter and my heart beats faster when you're around</li>
    <li>And without you my heart will always be and stay unfound</li>
    <li>And everytime we argued or fought I felt my heart getting drowned</li>
    <li>You're my angel and my precious queen that needs to be crowned</li>
    <li>You gave my life purpose you gave my life meaning</li>
    <li>You showed me what true love is and it's the most beautiful feeling</li>
    <li>And when I see that mesmerizing smile, My heart starts screaming</li>
    <li>I can't wait to admire your beauty when you're peacefully sleeping</li>
    <li>The longer I have you in my life the more my inner child is healing</li>
    <li>And my heart will always adore you as long as it's still beating</li>
    <li>And one thing that will never ever happen is either of us leaving.</li>
</ul>
